- <advanced title="Update: Veyon - fixes and new features">
Veyon integration has several fixes and updates. Changing the network during the desktop session 
does not prevent joining a Veyon session. Previously a login/logout was required to fix it. This update also 
changes the needed device configuration. From now on the Veyon session type (master/client)
is defined by user type. By default teacher becomes veyon master and student becomes client. Another
new feature is the possibility to invite users by their user group to join the Veyon session.
