## O2349 Aluminum - (DEVELOPMENT VERSION) {#opinsys-os-opinsys-bookworm-2023-12-05-084357-amd64}

This is the first release of the new major version of Opinsys OS, 
based on the Debian GNU/Linux 12 Bookworm distribution.

This release is still a development version still showing some bugs and
unfinished features. For example the user interface might still
undergo some small changes. These features will be fixed in upcoming releases.

This release is however mostly stable and is safe to use. The devices 
using this release are under normal maintainance and it is possible to update
them automatically to newer releases.
